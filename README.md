INFO: This repository is intended to give an insight into creating & manipulating data in MySQL. No supplementary front- nor back-end is anticipated at the moment.

The file "00_Database_Create-db" creates two databases: Company's Employees (tables: employees, department, HR data, benefits) and Company's Suppliers (tables: suppliers, orders and costs).

The remaining files gives an overview of the MySQL queries. All the queries are executed on the databases created via 00_Database_Create-db:
- 01_Queries_Add-remove: creating, deleting, adding, and uploading data;
- 02_Queries_Data-selection: data selection & manipulation;
- 03_Queries_Joins: joining data;
- 04_Queries_Numeric_Functions: arithmetic operations on the data.
- *** to be continued ***

DISCLAIMER: All the data used in these databases are fictitious. Any similarity to any data is entirely coincidental.
